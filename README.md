# CF_SQL
This repository contains files that showcase my SQL work from the CareerFoundry Data Analytics bootcamp.  
They are as follows:  
  
CareerFoundry_SQL.sql - contains PostgreSQL queries I created as I worked through the bootcamp exercises.

A3e10.pdf - contains a PowerPoint presentation for Rockbuster, a pseudo video rental business transitioning  
from physical media to streaming.  It is built from Tableau visualizations based on the output of  
PostgreSQL queries designed to glean strategic business insights from the data.
