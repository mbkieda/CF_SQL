This repository contains files that showcase some of my SQL work from the CareerFoundry Data Analytics bootcamp.
They are as follows:
CareerFoundry_SQL.sql - contains PostgreSQL queries I created as I worked through the exercises.

DD A3e10.pdf - contains a PowerPoint presentation for a pseudo video rental business transitioning
from physical media to streaming.  It is built from Tableau visualizations based on the output of
PostgreSQL queries designed to glean strategic business insights from the data
